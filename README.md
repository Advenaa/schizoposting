# Advena Letters

Advena Letters is a personal digital garden and note-taking website. It is built with Jekyll and designed for fast, seamless navigation and easy linking between ideas.

## Features

- **Seamless navigation:** Uses Turbo (Hotwire) for instant, app-like transitions between notes and pagesâ€”no full page reloads.
- **Backlinks:** Notes automatically show which other notes link to them, helping you discover connections between ideas.
- **Link previews:** Hover over internal links to preview note content without leaving the page.
- **Sidebar navigation:** Persistent sidebar for quick access to home, about, and social/contact links.
- **Markdown support:** Write notes in Markdown for easy formatting.
- **Responsive design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Static site:** Fast, secure, and easy to deploy anywhere (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## How it works

- Notes are stored as Markdown files in the `_notes/` directory.
- Pages like Home and About are in the `_pages/` directory.
- The site is generated by Jekyll, with custom plugins for backlinks and link previews.
- Turbo navigation is enabled by default for a smooth user experience.
