# Welcome to My Shit

Oh, you're here.

This is what happens when someone with too many thoughts and not enough impulse control gets access to vibecoding, so I created this website with the noble intention of sharing knowledge, which is obviously just code for "inflicting my random obsessions on anyone unfortunate enough to click a link."

## About Me

They call me Advena across the internet, you may find me in Discord servers where I'm passionately wrong about economics, Twitter threads where I'm explaining why TikTok's algorithm reveals the true nature of human desire, and comment sections where I'm that person who actually read the article before having opinions about it.

Here's what you need to understand: **To know Advena is to know chaos with a college degree.**

I'm that guy who falls down Wikipedia rabbit holes at 2 AM and emerges three hours later somehow connecting Renaissance double-entry bookkeeping to why Bitcoin mining is accidentally destroying the planet. I get genuinely excited about learning random shit, which sounds cute until you're trapped at a party listening to me explain why the housing market is legalized gambling.

The thing is, once I start seeing these patterns everywhere, I can't stop. Every system reveals another system, every rabbit hole branches into five more, and suddenly I'm that person who genuinely believes understanding how things work like it's the closest I'll get to having a useful skill. Unfortunately, this conviction tends to make me insufferable when talking to people, which is basically just pseudointellectual ADHD with a philosophy degree and delusions of relevance.

## Why "Stashes"?

Because that's literally what this is place, where I stash all the random shit my brain collects before it turns me into the kind of person who lectures some random nonsese that you don't actually need. But here's what's currently hoarded: 

**Random Intellectual Tangents** - Where I turn everyday irritations into deep insights about the human condition, like why people who walk slowly in hallways are secretly philosophers practicing mindfulness.

**My Own Trading Adventures** - AKA "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Losing Money While Pretending It's Educational." Featuring my ongoing relationship with market volatility and why I'm convinced technical analysis is just astrology for people who can't do what quants do.

**Techy stuff** - Where I have deeply philosophical thoughts about AI consciousness while literally using AI to write this entire About page.

**Philosophy for Anxious People** - Where I explain why existentialism is just depression with better marketing, and why optimistic nihilism is the only reasonable response to accidentally being conscious in an absurd universe.

**Creative Projects** - The ones that aren't currently decomposing in my drafts folder like digital compost.

Really, it's whatever captures my curiosity, which is everything, because my brain apparently missed the memo about focus being a useful life skill.

## Why Are You Still Reading This?

Look, this whole thing is just me throwing thoughts into the void and hoping someone finds them mildly interesting enough to feel less alone in their own existential confusion. If you want to argue about something I wrote, share a random fact that made you question reality, or just tell me why I'm completely wrong about something, please do.

I'm always down for conversations that start with "Hey, did you know..." and somehow end with us questioning whether free will exists or if we're all just very sophisticated biological algorithms pretending to make choices.
